    using fonts other than the Computer Modern Roman family or if you

    LaTeX does provide macros for these characters, but their names

This replaces BibTeX's year and month fields.  Its value should be
written in ISO 8601 format, e.g., 1967-02-24.  The day and/or month
can be omitted, so all of the following are valid representations of
February 24, 1967:
```
date={1967-02-24}
date={1967-02}
date={1967}
```
Using this format allows amsrefs maximum flexibility in formatting
dates, for example, by allowing month names to be printed in full or
abbreviated as necessary.

For Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall, either use month numbers of 13, 14,
15, 16 (respectively) or just put in the text before the year:
```
date={Summer 1987},
```
For compatibility, year is provided as an alias for date, but its use
is discouraged.

- amsrefs tries very hard to format multiple contributions, each of
  which may have multiple authors, in an appropriate way.  However,
  there might be cases where the default rules aren't flexible enough,
  in which case you can instead use the contribution field as a simple
  field and format it exactly the way you want:

      contribution={some arbitrary text about contributions}

This feature should only be used as a last resort, though.
